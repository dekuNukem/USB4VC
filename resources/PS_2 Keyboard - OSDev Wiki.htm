<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Overview"> Overview </span></h2>
<p>The PS/2 Keyboard is a device that talks to a PS/2 controller using <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/PS/2" title="PS/2">serial communication</a>.
 Ideally, each different type of PS/2 controller driver should provide 
some sort of standard/simple "send byte/receive byte" interface, and the
 PS/2 Keyboard driver would use this interface without caring about 
lower level details (like what type of PS/2 controller the device is 
plugged into).
</p><p>The PS/2 Keyboard accepts commands and sends responses to those 
commands, and also sends scan codes indicating when a key was pressed or
 released. Keep in mind that these scan codes (from the tables below) 
may be altered (i.e. translated) by the PS/2 controller, depending on 
the controller's settings.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Commands"> Commands </span></h2>
<p>A PS/2 Keyboard accepts many types of commands. A command is one 
byte. Some commands have data byte/s which must be sent after the 
command byte. The keyboard typically responds to a command by sending 
either an "ACK" (to acknowledge the command) or a "Resend" (to say 
something was wrong with the previous command) back. Don't forget to 
wait between the command, the data and the response from keyboard.
</p><p>The commands that a PS/2 Keyboard accepts are:

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Special_Bytes"> Special Bytes </span></h2>

</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Driver_Model"> Driver Model </span></h2>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Command_Queue_and_State_Machine"> Command Queue and State Machine </span></h3>
<p>Commands must be sent one at a time (e.g. if your driver is interrupt
 driven, you can't start sending a command within the IRQ handler 
because code outside the IRQ handler may be in the middle of sending a 
command). The command isn't completed until you've received an ACK for 
it. For example, if you send a command and the keyboard responds with 
"0xFE (resend)" then you have to send the command again (possibly 
limited to 3 retries before you give up and assume the keyboard doesn't 
support the command you're sending or there's been a hardware failure). 
Finally, sometimes you want to send several commands at once. For 
example, you might have a "reinitialise()" function that sets the scan 
code set, sets the typematic byte, sets the LEDs and enables scanning.
</p><p>The simplest way to achieve this is for the driver to maintain a 
queue of commands. When you add a command to the queue, if the queue is 
empty you start sending the command; otherwise you append the command to
 the queue. When you receive an "0xFA (ACK)" from the keyboard you 
discard the command at the head of the queue and start sending the next 
command in the queue (if any). If you receive an "0xFE (Resend)" from 
the keyboard you can resend the command at the head of the queue.
</p><p>The remainder of the driver should be a kind of state machine. 
The state machine moves into a different state when some commands are 
successfully completed, and when various bytes are received from the 
keyboard. For example, the driver might be in a default state and 
receive a break code that puts it into a "waiting for scan code after 
receiving break code" state. Then it might receive the first byte of a 
multi-byte scan code and shift to a "waiting for second byte of scan 
code after receiving break code" state. Finally it might receive the 
second/last byte of the scan code and then switch back to the default 
state.
</p><p><br>
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Scan_Code_Sets.2C_Scan_Codes_and_Key_Codes"> Scan Code Sets, Scan Codes and Key Codes </span></h3>
<p>A scan code set is a set of codes that determine when a key is 
pressed or repeated, or released. There are 3 different sets of scan 
codes. The oldest is "scan code set 1", the default is "scan code set 
2", and there is a newer (more complex) "scan code set 3". <i>Note: 
Normally on PC compatible systems the keyboard itself uses scan code set
 2 and the keyboard controller translates this into scan code set 1 for 
compatibility. See <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/%228042%22_PS/2_Controller#Translation" title="&quot;8042&quot; PS/2 Controller">"8042"_PS/2_Controller</a> for more information about this translation.</i>
</p><p>Modern keyboards should support all three scan code sets, however
 some don't. Scan code set 2 (the default) is the only scan code set 
that is guaranteed to be supported. In theory (I haven't tried it) it 
should be possible to attempt to set scan code set 1 or scan code set 3,
 and then ask the keyboard which scan code it is currently using and see
 if it actually is using the requested scan code set. In this way it may
 be possible to determine which scan code sets the keyboard does 
support.
</p><p>Scan codes themselves are sequences of one or more bytes. In some
 cases the sequence can be as many as 6 bytes (e.g. the Pause/Break key 
in scan code set 1 
generates the sequence 0xE1, 0x1D, 0x45, 0xE1, 0x9D, 0xC5 when pressed).
 This situation isn't really ideal. In general (for later processing) 
you want to convert these "one or more byte sequences" into a single 
integer that uniquely identifies a specific key, that can be used 
effectively in things like lookup tables (without having sparsely used 
"many GiB" lookup tables).
</p><p>There is no standard for "key codes" - it's something you have to
 make up or invent for your OS. I personally like the idea of having an 
8-bit key code where the highest 3 bits determine which row on the 
keyboard and the lowest 5 bits determine which column (essentially, the 
keyboard is treated as a grid of up to 8 rows and up to 32 columns of 
keys). Regardless of what you choose to use for your key codes, it 
should be something that is used by all keyboard drivers (including USB 
Keyboards) and could possibly also be used for other input devices (e.g.
 left mouse button might be treated as "key code 0xF1").
</p><p>Basically, when the keyboard driver's state machine knows it has 
received a complete scan code, the next step is to convert the "one or 
more byte" scan code into a key code.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Key_Codes.2C_Key_States_and_Key_Mappings"> Key Codes, Key States and Key Mappings </span></h3>
<p>Once you've got key codes, then next step is to keep track of which 
keys are currently being pressed. Imagine a computer game that uses the 
"WASD" keys for player movement - when the 'A' key is being pressed the 
player rotates clockwise. How does the game know if the 'A' key is 
currently being pressed? For this you'd want an array of flags, where 
each flag corresponds to a key code. There is a hidden bonus here - the 
keyboard driver itself can use the same "array of flags" to determine if
 a shift key, control key, alt key, etc is down, which can be quite 
useful when trying to convert the key code into an actual ASCII 
character or Unicode code point. For example, if the user presses the 
'a' key then it might correspond to 'a' or 'A' (depending on capslock 
state and whether or not a shift key is being held down at the time) or 
might not correspond to a valid character at all (e.g. "control-a" or 
"alt-a").
</p><p>Also note that (for example) a "WASD" game doesn't care if the 
keys are 'W', 'A', 'S' and 'D'. The game wants to know about keys in a 
specific "T-shaped" pattern on the left of the keyboard. If the keyboard
 happens to be something different, then the keys in the same location 
may be completely different (e.g. they would be '&lt;', 'A', 'O' and 'E'
 keys on a Dvorak keyboard). This helps to explain my preference of 
having an 8-bit key code where the highest 3 bits determine which row on
 the keyboard and the lowest 5 bits determine which column (it's easy 
for a game to ask about the state of the third key on the left of the 
third row).
</p><p>Once you're able to keep track of which keys are currently being 
pressed, the next step is to (attempt to) convert the key into an ASCII 
character or Unicode code point. At this point you need to know what 
type of keyboard the user has - is it "US QWERTY", or "French AZERTY", 
some form of Dvorak, or perhaps it's Arabic. To handle many different 
keyboard layouts, the keyboard driver needs to use tables to convert key
 codes into ASCII characters or Unicode code points; so that you only 
need to load a different "Key Mapping" table to support different 
keyboard layouts.
</p><p>However, it's not quite that simple. Different keyboard layouts 
can have different meta keys, different status LEDs, etc. The Key 
Mapping table has to sort these differences out too. This is why you 
don't want to detect if the keyboard LEDs have changed earlier, but want
 to send the "set LEDs" command (if necessary) *after* you've found the 
entry for the key code in your key map table.
</p><p>The final step of processing is to combine all relevant 
information into some sort of "keypress packet" structure, and send it 
to whomever (e.g. GUI). The entire "keypress packet" might include the 
following:
</p>
<ul><li> Unicode code point (if applicable)
</li><li> Key code
</li><li> Pressed/released flag
</li><li> Various other key states (shift, alt, control, etc)
</li><li> Various "toggle" states (CapsLock, ScrollLock, NumberLock, etc)
</li></ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Scan_Code_Sets"> Scan Code Sets </span></h2>
<p>As there are 3 different scan code sets, there are 3 different tables
 (one for each scan code set). Some of the scan codes correspond to 
extra keys that have been added over time and have become "relatively 
standard". To help keep track scan codes have been categorized and 
tagged in the tables below. The tags used are:

<p>Note: Don't let the name fool you - these keys have nothing to do

useful for an OS that supports power management).

etc), some are intended for web browsing (previous web page, next web 
page, refresh, favourites/bookmarks, etc), and and some are intended for
 launching applications (e.g. starting an email client, starting a
